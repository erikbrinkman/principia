A command line utility for generating plots roughly according to the guiding ideas behind [Principiae](http://www.principiae.be).
This [video](https://youtu.be/6lm4wJ1qm0w) presents a quick discussion on the types of plots that this tool is meant to capture.
The command contains several useful sub-commands that are meant to be chained together.
