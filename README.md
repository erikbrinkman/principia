A library for making plots loosely based off of Principiae.

This library is meant to work with d3 and at some point should provide methods for conveniently making plots in the way that I like to, but the most appropriate way to structure that is uncertain, so for now it just includes routines to do what I find necessary.


Todo
----

- `turf` is a large dependency and geo focused.
  It should probably be stripped out in favor of a more appropriate library.
- Bar graphs.
- Area charts (i.e. area between lines is filled in)
